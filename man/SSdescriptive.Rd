\title{
  Sample size determination for a descriptive study.
}
\description{
  Compute the necessary sample size for a descriptive study. This must only be used if no further analysis is planned. 
In most cases, one must assume that every answers to a dichotomous question throughout the survey will be split perfectly between the two possibilities.
}
\usage{
  SSdescriptive(N.tot, e = 0.05, p = 0.5, alpha = 0.05)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{N.tot}{
    Estimation de la taille de la population ciblee.
}
  \item{e}{
    The error margin, the precision of the confidence intervals. Default is \code{e = 0.05}.
}
  \item{p}{
    Prevalence in the average questions of the survey, often 0.5 if no other hypothesis can be imposed. Default is \code{p = 0.5} as we assume that the survey will contains several questions.
}
  \item{alpha}{
Type I error. Corresponds to the size of the confindence interval. Default is \code{alpha = 0.05}.
