\title{
Sample size determination for linear regression
}
\description{
Compute the necessary sample size for a linear regression analysis. This is based on, and improves the \code{pwr.f2.test} function from the \code{pwr} package.
}
\usage{
  SSlinearReg(R, df, mod = NULL,
             alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{R}{
Squared root of the estimate coefficient of determination for the model. 
}
  \item{df}{
Number of degrees of freedom for the model, ie. total number of variables minus one.
}
  \item{mod}{
An \code{lm} object that can be used instead of \code{R} and \code{df}. 
This is unusual as one must most of the time estimate \code{R} and \code{df} from previous studies and do not have direct access to a model.
}
  \item{alpha}{
    Type I Error. Default is 0.05.
}
  \item{power}{
    1 - Type II Error. Default is 0.80.
